### Particle System

Welcome! This mini-project aims to build a dynamic particle system using p5.js, where particles are continuously emitted, move across the canvas, and gradually disappear over time. The system is designed with an emitter that generates particles with randomized properties such as speed, size, and lifespan, creating a visually appealing effect. As particles age and reach their lifespan, they are removed and replaced with new ones, ensuring a seamless and continuous animation. This project mainly focuses on **Constructor Functions**, **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, and **Encapsulation** to build a system from scratch.

**Features:**

- _Dynamic Particle Emission_ – Particles are generated with randomized properties, creating a unique effect every time.
- _Smooth Motion & Lifespan Control_ – Each particle moves independently, fades over time, and is replaced efficiently.
- _Optimized Performance_ – Old particles are removed, and new ones are spawned dynamically to maintain a stable frame rate.
